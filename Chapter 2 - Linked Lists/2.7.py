Intersection: Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
Return the interÂ­ secting node. Note that the intersection is determined based on reference, not value.
hat is, if the kth node of the  rst linked list is the exact same node (by reference)
as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.
